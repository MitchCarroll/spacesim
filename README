I love Orbiter (2006, 2010, I love them both), but they both suck at running with Wine, and don't run natively in anything other than 
Windows. This is especialy sad, because it seems to me that many of the people that would enjoy Linux, and those that would enjoy
Orbiter are the same people.

Anyway, I don't know if i could ever write the "next Orbiter", but I'm going to take a stab at writing my own take on space simulation.

I'm also sick and tired of "space simulators" that simulate space itself, but not much more.

I'd like to implement multiplayer capability as well. I mean, who DOESN'T want a persistant MMO space sim?

Furthermore, in honor of Robert A. Heinlein, I'd like to provide some sort of interface for such things as sextants, astrolabes, slide-rules
plotting tables, etc. That way you can have your own classic sci-fi style adventures in the style of The Rolling Stones, Rocketship Galileo,
or maybe even Starman Jones.

At the moment, wasd -> camera controls(absolute), arrow keys->rotate spaceship, spacebar->print current altitude to terminal
