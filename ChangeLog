    Update NEWS

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-22

    added an attitude indicator, or "8-Ball"
    
    also made texture loading function more generic, and made a stab
    at adding a texture to the spaceship. TODO: spaceship meshes.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-20

    Corrected flipped texture, and Earth's spin.
    
    Again, though, these are completely temporary. Will probably
    just incorporate someone else's texture loading library,
    and will definitely be modularizing the code for Bodys more.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-18

    cleaned up build tree some more
    
    these didn't get added in the last commit, apparently.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-18

    Modified cleaned build tree.
    
    Removed all build files in src/ except for Makefile.am and
    reconfigured the build tree.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-15

    textured Earth
    
    added a modified PNM file (has magic number, comment, and
    color depth info removed. TODO: better texture loading)

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-12

    modified src/Makefile.am to provide DATADIR macro
    
    use DATADIR before filenames in src. e.g.:
    infile.open(DATADIR "earth.png");
    also cleaned up Makefile.am in other subdirs to point the
    preprocessor to the correct include and link directories

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-10

    updated README

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-10

    fixed the distribution system so it now distributes and installs the data file
    
    the only data file right now is earth.png; it is in the data subdir,
    and should get installed somewhere like /usr/local/share/space-simulator/
    TODO: start migrating some of the functionality to config files and extensions

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-10

    spaceship now orbits a bit more circularly

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-10

    spacebar now prints altitude velocity x y z

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-09

    added a line to instruments.txt

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-09

    fixed autotools to build correctly when libvtx is not already installed

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-03

    added a data folder with a texture for Earth in it, and some ideas for instruments.
    
    not sure how to use either yet. TODO!

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-02

    left and right arrow keys now control roll, not yaw.
    
    eventually, the controls and all will need to be modularized into a
    separate package so that you can have all your flight controls and
    instruments change based on what vessel you are using. baby steps :)

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-02

    first crack at using quaternions for rotation in the main program.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-02

    added getRotation to Quat. returns a Quat containing the angle in degrees,
    and the axis that correspond to the quaternion. suitable for glRotate.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-05-02

    some cleanup on libquat, and added quaternion rotation.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-25

    Update NEWS

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-25

    Added some basic functionality to the Quat class. Split some of main.cpp into the Body class and header.
    Rotation not yet implemented.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-25

    Added nested quat library to handle quaternion rotation. fixed autotool and such.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-20

    FIXED depth test and cull face. everything renders as it should now.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-20

    made soem changes to the camera code. again.

C. Mitch Carroll <c.mitch.carroll@gmail.com>	2013-04-19

    cleaning up code and trying to fix camera
