20130418 - added absolute camera controls, altitude printout, put ship in orbit
	 - added lighting (FIXME) and basic materials. everything is still
	 - hardcoded. TODO: Add modularity
20130425 - added Quat class, and split some of main.cpp into the Body class and header.
20130522 - Earth is now textured, there is an attitude indicator (textured also), and a primitive texture
	   loading routine. The Rocket is now in a proper orbit, albeit a highly eccentric one. TODO: check for
	   accuracy. Lighting is basically correct now, and comes from the Sun, not the camera.
20130606 - Major code refactor. Whole bunch of changes, MOSTLY to decrease
messiness. most things function properly now. still need to figure out why
the thrust vector isn't rotating properly. Applied GNU indent style to all
source files.
20130610 - using gluLookAt() for camera transformation now.
